# DSPLib_CSharp_DotNet4
Originally posted on Code Project in 2016, moved here because of the Code Project sites demise.

## Introduction:
There is a real need for a ready to use Fourier Transform Library that users can take right out of the
box and perform Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) or Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT) and get a
classical spectrum versus frequency plot.  
The vast majority of code that you will find in Commercial packages, Open Source libraries,
Textbooks and on the Web are simply unsuited for this task and takes hours of further tweaking to
get a classic and properly scaled spectrum plot.  
The library presented here is a practical, organized and complete .NET 4+ Open Source library of
DSP oriented routines released under the very non-restrictive MIT License.  
  
# Features:  
  1) 100% .NET 4 managed code (no PInvoke!)    
  2) Uses the offical .NET 4 Complex Data type.  
  3) Complete C# Source Code, no third party DLL's needed.  
  4) Many worked examples.

# Usage:
See the full PDF Users guide at,
The example project is in the 'examples' directory.
The C# source code for use in your projects is in the 'src' directory.
